# BlenderBuild
A open-source plugin developed in python to make possible build any LEGO Model, render in High Quality and make the Step-by-Step Manual


This plugin allows you to create and manipulate LEGO assemblies in blender.

It works as a toolbox where you will have access to tools so that the fittings of the parts are correctly positioned, the import of parts is not something tedious and that the animation is possible with the click of a button.

The base scene from which the pieces are imported is: /cena_pecas/wedo_piecesv1.7.blend

The buttons_blender_25082017_documentado.py code should be run in the python console within blender. Then a palette with the tools will be created.

The results of renders and assemblies can be seen in the folder "sistema de montagens resultado"

*In the code remember to change the lines so that the address of the files is correct for your machine


NEXT STEPS: Make the plugin interface all in Web Interface, and the conection with blender in a API restful running in a local server.
